1. Prevent a hotel from renouncing a bidder / API key to void offers / existing confirmations
Allow setting of global response options (ie. not just per bidline options)
2. Implement timestamp for granting of granting and revocation of roles. use

struct Timestamps {
  uint128 granted;
  uint128 revoked;
}
